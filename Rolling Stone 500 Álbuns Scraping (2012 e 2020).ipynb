When Hova isn’t taking shots at record executives, cops, critics, haters, biters, and his absent dad (and still, sadly, using the word “faggot”), he inches toward vulnerability on “Song Cry.” “Izzo (H.O.V.A.),” with dynamic production by Kanye West, gave him his first Top 10 single. Jay-Z elevates clever rhymes and innovations with an unmatched air of calm control and a cavalier confidence.

Their music is about duality too, matching Big Boi’s imperative to “make the club get crunk” with André’s determination to “activate the left and right brain.” André was the virtuoso, clipping off compound rhymes with grace, while Big Boi’s more grounded flow and clear diction rooted their songs. Hits like “Rosa Parks”\\u2008put the duo’s hometown “Hotlanta” on the rap map, and at a time when formulaic albums by Master P and Puff Daddy topped the charts, OutKast unleashed an explosive sound that used live musicianship, social commentary, and a heavy dose of deep funk to create the greatest record ever to come out of the Dirty South.'},\n",

You don’t just run to play this music because you think you can make a million off it.” Ironically, this set of the late reggae idol’s greatest hits has sold in the millions. On a single disc, it captures everything that made him an international icon: his nuanced songcraft, his political message, and — of course — the universal soul he brought to Jamaican rhythm and Rastafarian spirituality in the gunfighter ballad “I\\u2008Shot the Sheriff,” the comforting swing of “No Woman, No Cry,” and the holy promise of “Redemption Song.”'},\n",

Clocking in at just 29 minutes, Ramones is a complete rejection of the spangled artifice of 1970s rock. The songs were fast and anti-social, just like the band: “Beat on the Brat,”\\u2008“Blitzkrieg Bop,”\\u2008“Now I\\u2008Wanna Sniff Some Glue.”\\u2008Guitarist Johnny Ramone refused to play solos — his jackhammer chords became the lingua franca of punk — and the whole record cost just more than $600 to make.

With the fluid energy and expertise of guitarist Ray Phiri and the vocal troupe Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Simon created an album about isolation and redemption that transcended world music to become the whole world’s soundtrack.'},\n",

So he recorded one of the great albums of the Eighties. Times is best known for the apocalyptic title track, the brontosaurus funk of “Housequake,” and the gorgeous “If I Was Your Girlfriend.” Yet the simplest moments are unforgettable: the “Sweet Jane”-style guitar plea of “The Cross,” the Stax revamp on “Slow Love,” a jilted girl’s sadness in “I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man.” “I hate the word ;experiment,;” Prince said. “It sounds like something you didn’t finish.” Here, he finished.'},\n",

With lines like “I never sleep, ’cause sleep is the cousin of death,” Nas showed more poetic style than any MC since Rakim. His debut begins with the sound of a subway train, and for the next 39 minutes, he seems to visit every street corner from Queens to Brooklyn, detailing drug deals, escapism, persecution, prison life, and survival. Throughout, he displays a pure focus (there’s only one guest verse) and explosive dexterity; it’s one thing to say “I drop the ancient manifested hip-hop,” as he does in the first verse of “Memory Lane,” it’s another to back that up with a stunning, acrobatic second verse. Illmatic was an instant classic that never crossed over, which only deepened its myth with hip-hop heads.'},\n",

The sound is dominated by the low end of the title — they even recruited legendary jazz bassist Ron Carter (who’d worked with Thelonious Monk and Miles Davis). As Carter gets dope on the double bass, the Tribe discourse on matters ranging from the music industry (“Show Business”) to sexual politics (“The Infamous Date Rape”).

OK is where the band began pulling at its sound like taffy, seeing what happened, not worrying if it was still “rock.” What resulted is a slow, haunting album with unforgettable tracks such as “Karma Police.” Guitarist Jonny Greenwood said, “I got very excited at the prospect of doing string parts that didn’t sound like ‘Eleanor Rigby,’ which is what all string parts have sounded like for the past 30 years.… We used violins to make frightening white-noise stuff, like the last chord of ‘Climbing Up the Walls.’;'},\n",

And the entire album burns with apocalyptic cohesion: the sex-mad desperation of “Live With Me”; the murderous blues of “Midnight Rambler”; Keith Richards’ lethal, biting guitar on “Monkey Man”; the epic moralism, with honky-tonk piano and massed vocal chorus, of “You Can’t Always Get What You Want,” which Mick Jagger wrote on acoustic guitar in his bedroom. “Somebody said that we could get the London Bach Choir,”\\u2008Jagger recalled, “and we said, ‘That will be a laugh.';\"},\n",

       "  'Descrição': 'This album documents one of the most elaborate self-mythologizing schemes in rock, as David Bowie created the glittery, messianic alter ego Ziggy Stardust (“well-hung and snow-white tan”). The glam rock Bowie made with guitarist Mick Ronson is an irresistible blend of sexy, campy pop and blues power, with enduring tracks like “Hang On to Yourself” and “Suffragette City.” The anthem “Ziggy Stardust” was one of rock’s earliest, and best, power ballads. “I consider myself responsible for a whole new school of pretensions,” Bowie said. “They know who they are.

Remain in Light marked Talking Heads’ transformation from avatars of the punk avant-garde to polyrhythmic magicians with hit-single appeal. Just try not dancing to “Once in a Lifetime.”'},\n",

But then Dr. Dre turned samples of Clinton’s P-Funk sides into G-Funk, and Dr. Funkenstein approved, calling funk “the DNA of hip-hop and rap.” Dre had already taken gangsta rap to the mainstream with his earlier group, N.W.A, but on The Chronic, he funked up the rhymes with a smooth bass-heavy production style and the laid-back delivery of then-unknown rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg.

But the unstoppable dance tracks on Off the Wall remain classic examples of Jackson as a one-man disco inferno. “Don’t Stop ;Til You Get Enough,”\\u2008“Rock With You,” and “Burn\\u2008This Disco Out” still get the party started today.'},\n",

With Innervisions, Wonder offered a landmark fusion of social realism and spiritual idealism; he brings expressive color and irresistible funk to his synth-based keyboards on “Too High” (a cautionary anti-drug song) and “Higher Ground” (which echoes Martin Luther King Jr.’s message of transcendence). The album’s centerpiece is “Living for the City,” a cinematic depiction of exploitation and injustice. ;Innervisions gives my own perspective on what;s happening in my world,” Wonder said. “I think it is my most personal album.

But as a child of the Nineties, she also loved hip-hop and wrote openly about her splattered relationships and issues with drugs and alcohol. Her breakthrough second album (recorded in Brooklyn with co-producers Mark Ronson and Salaam Remi) marked the arrival of a resplendently damaged 21st-century torch singer. Tracks like the mildly pushy “You Know I’m No Good” and the sumptuous “Love Is a Loving Game” had an elegant, beguiling smudginess that avoided the wax-museum quality of so much retro soul. “My odds are stacked,” Winehouse sings. “I’ll go back to black.” Indeed, the pain and tumult in her voice was very real.

She dropped the album as a Saturday-night surprise, knocking the world sideways — her most expansive and personal statement, tapping into marital breakdown and the state of the nation. It was a different side than she’d shown before, raging over infidelity and jealousy, but reveling in the militant-feminist-funk strut of “Formation.” All over <em>Lemonade</em>\\xa0she explores the betrayals of American blackness, claiming her place in all of America’s music traditions — she goes outlaw country on “Daddy Lessons,” she digs blues metal with Jack White on “Don’t Hurt Yourself,” she revamps the Yeah Yeah Yeahs on “Hold Up.” Ashes to ashes, dust to side chicks — all hail the queen.'},\n",

       "  'Descrição': 'This painterly masterpiece is one of the most important, inﬂuential, and popular albums in jazz. At the time it was made, Kind of Blue was also a revolution all its own. Turning his back on standard chord progressions, trumpeter Miles Davis used modal scales as a starting point for composition and improvisation — breaking new ground with warmth, subtlety, and understatement in the thick of hard bop. Davis and his peerless band — bassist Paul Chambers, drummer Jimmy Cobb, pianist Bill Evans, and the titanic sax team of John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley — soloed in uncluttered settings, typiﬁed by “melodic rather than harmonic variation,” as Davis put it. Two numbers, “All Blues” and “Freddie Freeloader” (the latter featuring Wynton Kelly at the ivories in place of Evans), are in 12-bar form, but Davis’ approach allowed his players a cool, new, collected freedom.'},\n",

Jimi Hendrix’s incendiary guitar was historic in itself, the luminescent sum of his chitlin-circuit labors with Little Richard and the Isley Brothers and his melodic exploitation of amp howl. But it was the pictorial heat of songs like “Manic Depression”\\u2008and “The Wind Cries Mary” that established the transcendent promise of psychedelia. Backed by drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, the guitarist made soul music for inner space. “It’s a collection of free feeling and imagination,” he said of the album. “Imagination is very important.” Widely assumed to be about an acid trip, “Purple Haze” had “nothing to do with drugs,” Hendrix insisted. “‘Purple Haze’ was all about a dream I had that I was walking under the sea.”'},\n",

But I knew how to convey the mood and emotion of a song with honest, straight-from-the-heart interpretation.” The resulting collection of songs saw King remake herself as an artist and became one of the biggest-selling albums of all time, creating the reigning model for the 1970s female singer-songwriter.'},\n",

Pepper christened the Summer of Love with the lavish psychedelic daydream “Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,” the jaunty Ringo Starr-sung communality anthem “With a Little Help From My Friends,” the album-closing multilayered masterwork, “A Day in the Life,” and the title track, which introduced the alter egos the Beatles had developed for the ambitious project. “It liberated you,” McCartney said. “You could do anything.” It is hard to imagine a more perfect setting for the Victorian jollity of John Lennon’s “Being for the Beneﬁt of Mr. Kite!” (inspired by an 1843 circus poster) or the sumptuous melancholy of McCartney’s “Fixing a Hole,” with its blend of antique shadows (a harpsichord played by the Beatles’ producer George Martin) and modern sunshine lead guitar executed with ringing precision by George Harrison).

Much of what we take for granted in rock would not exist without this New York band or its seminal debut: the androgynous sexuality of glitter, punk’s raw noir, the blackened-riff howl of grunge and noise rock. It is a record of fearless breadth and lyrical depth. Singer-songwriter Lou Reed documented carnal desire and drug addiction with a pop wisdom he learned as a song-factory composer for Pickwick Records. Cale introduced the power of pulse and drone (from his work in early minimalism); guitarist Sterling Morrison and drummer Maureen Tucker played with tribal force; Nico, a German vocalist brieﬂy added to the band by manager Andy Warhol, brought an icy femininity to the heated ennui in Reed’s songs.

He knew he had something big in his nascent version of “What’s Going On,” but the rest of the Four Tops weren’t interested, and Benson’s efforts to get Joan Baez to record it didn’t work out, either.'},\n",

While he recuperated, the Band backed him on the demos later known as The Basement Tapes and made their own debut. Dylan offered to play on the album; the Band said no thanks. “We didn’t want to just ride his shirttail,” drummer Levon Helm said. Dylan contributed “I Shall Be Released” and co-wrote two other tunes. But it was the rustic beauty of the Band’s music and the incisive drama of their own reflections on family and obligations, such as “The Weight,” that made Big Pink an instant homespun classic.'},\n",

The lead single, “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,” was stomping, swaying electro-twang. “I Know You Were Trouble” rode a dubstep groove, and the title track was a swirl of banjos, dusty guitars, and talk-box elation. Tabloid types tied themselves in knots trying to figure out which song was about which ex, but the real news was Swift’s songwriting on high points like the astonishing “All Too Well,” as vivid a post-breakup remembrance as any artist has ever produced.'},\n",

The title track is one of Williams’ best:\\u2008Over guitars that owe more to the Stones than to the Opry, she tells a story about the rootlessness of American life. Williams, who was born in Louisiana, describes the South in a loving, fearful tone (“Broken down shacks, engine parts” in one song, “Busted-down doors and borrowed cash” in another) and mourns pals who fell prey to hard liquor, drugs, or dreams of stardom. With production help from Roy Bittan of the E Street Band and a lot of twangy power chords, Williams rocks hard enough to give these troubled songs both dignity and a feeling of release.'},\n",

When the band slows down on “Welcome Home (Sanitarium),” it just emphasizes the unrelenting nature of the rest of the songs.

But by stripping back their sound to a spare, largely acoustic essence, the college-rock kings made the most powerful album of their career — an argument for sweetness and softness in an increasingly hard world. The bold sonic change-up laid bare Michael Stipe’s keening baritone and expansive vocal melodies, accentuated in several songs by Led Zeppelin member John Paul Jones’ gorgeous string arrangements. The album “was beautiful. It was quiet,” Stipe said. “It flew in the face of everything that was going down musically at the time.” At a time when grunge angst ruled, songs like “Everybody Hurts” and the lovely “Find the River” offered solace.'},\n",

But Supa Dupa Fly introduced everyone to Missy’s world, with avant-funk cosmic swamp beats from Timbaland. What a team: two kids from Virginia Beach, Virginia, dazzling the planet with a playful homegrown sound nobody could imitate. “The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)” was the breakout hit, taking an old-school Ann Peebles soul oldie and looping it into a Dirty South jam — Missy sings, raps, giggles, and talks her shit. Supa Dupa Fly changed the sound of hip-hop, but also kicked off a tradition — every year, Missy and Tim would score the jam of the summer, while everybody else was still trying to catch up with what they did the summer before.'},\n",

It started with some musings on extraterrestrial life, then got really far out: jazzy drumming, funky balladry, liquid guitar solos, dragonfly heavy metal, and the immortal stoner’s maxim from “If Six Was Nine”:\\u2008“I’m the one who’s got to die when it’s time for me to die, so let me live my life the way I want to.” All over the album, Hendrix was inventing new ways to make the electric guitar roar, sing, talk, shriek, flutter, and fly.

Baduizm’s Seventies-meets-Nineties vibe, Badu’s exquisite lyricism (“On &amp; On” is at once spiritual, apocalyptic, and funny), and jazz-steeped cadences (see “Appletree”) combined to make the 25-year-old singer a figurehead for the neo-soul genre that essentially began with this album.'},\n",

Lennon attacks and denies idols and icons, including his own former band (“I don’t believe in Beatles,” he sings in “God”), to hit a pure, raw core of confession that, in its echo-drenched, garage-rock crudity, is years ahead of punk. He deals with childhood loss in “Mother” and skirts blasphemy in “Working Class Hero”: “You’re still fucking peasants as far as I can see.” But the unkindest cut came in his frank 1970 Rolling Stone interview. “The Beatles was nothing,” Lennon stated acerbically.'},\n",

Side One had hits like “Running Up That Hill” and “Cloudbusting”; Side Two was an epic “story suite,” moving from goth terror to sci-fi abstraction to dark rustic revelry.

James Brown defied King Records boss Syd Nathan’s opposition to a live album by arranging to record a show himself — on October 24th, 1962, the last date of a run at Harlem’s Apollo Theater.

Talking Book was full of introspection and social commentary, with Wonder producing, writing, and playing most of the instruments himself. “Superstition” and “You Are the Sunshine of My Life” were Number One singles; “Big Brother” is political consciousness draped in a light melody: “You’ve killed all our leaders/I don’t even have to do nothin’ to you/You’ll cause your own country to fall.”'},\n",

Long after the genre petered out, their debut remains immersive and haunting, built on skittering break beats, jazzy samples, spare arrangements, and discomforting pauses.

There’s plenty of thematic contrast — the playful bedroom come-on “Mary Jane (All Night Long),” a smashing cover of the 1970s funk ballad “I’m Going Down” — but the strongest impression from the album is that Blige had been through it, and her hopefulness was hard-won.'},\n",

But he went through a private hell on his way to success; the hit “Fire and Rain” was inspired by his stay in a psychiatric institution in the mid-1960s (he had committed himself) and the suicide of a close friend. In the months before making this album, Taylor committed himself again, this time to kick heroin. His confessional lyrics set a new standard, as did the spare melodicism of his songs.

A biracial cult band from L.A. that rarely gigged out of town in its 1960s heyday, Love were Lee’s vehicle for a pioneering folk-rock turned into elegant armageddon with the symphonic sweep and mariachi-brass drama of “Alone Again Or,” “Andmoreagain,” and “You Set the Scene.” In the late Nineties, Lee served time in prison.

The percolating “Enjoy the Silence” became their only U.S. Top 10 single, and “Policy of Truth” did almost as well.

Said Paul Westerberg, “This was the first time I had songs that we arranged, rather than just banging out riffs.” Mixing punk, pop, and country with wry lyrics, his songs describe heroes (the gender-bending couple in “Androgynous”) and villains (an unsanitary dentist in “Tommy Gets His Tonsils Out”; MTV in “Seen Your Video”), and pack in quips about the group;s lack of success (“Fingernails and cigarettes, a lousy dinner”) with swagger and pride. The coup is “Unsatisfied,” a pained howl of unhappiness that forced people to take this ratty band seriously.'},\n",

Franklin, on hand and Mick Jagger dancing in the back of the congregation, this return to Aretha Franklin;s gospel roots remains the bestselling album of her career, containing, arguably, the greatest singing she recorded. Part of this is because it didn’t sound like it took place in a church; Franklin approaches sacred songs as if they were soul standards, and delivers Carole King’s “You’ve Got a Friend” like it’s a hymn. “How I Got Over,” her fervent thank you to Jesus, must have made the Lord blush.'},\n",

The shock came partly from her lyrics, which were often proclamations of sexual compulsion, and also from the intense dynamic shifts in her music, which careen from blues to goth, often in the space of one song. Harvey was under the influence of Howlin’ Wolf, Tom Waits, and Flannery O’Connor, and her singing, writing, and lead-guitar playing coalesce into something marked by flames. The lyrics have lots of licking, moaning, bleeding, stroking, open mouths, and dismembered body parts. The songs spew viscera as they build to a sticky ecstasy.'},\n",

The Pretenders’ debut is filled with no-nonsense New Wave rock such as “Mystery Achievement” — plus a cover of “Stop Your Sobbing,” by the Kinks’ Ray Davies (three years later, the father of Hynde’s child). The biggest hit was “Brass in Pocket,” a song of ambition and seduction. Hynde, however, wasn’t so sure about the song’s success. “I was embarrassed by it,” she said. “I hated it so much that if I was in Woolworth’s and they started playing it, I’d have to run out of the store.”'},\n",

Drenching his voice in Auto-Tune and turning his synths to their coldest settings, he sang of unbearable winters, shattered love, and endless nightmares. Part of West’s healing was charting a path where the distinction between rapping and singing was beside the point.

It was a gamble to break up their twin alchemy this way, but in dividing themselves, OutKast conquered: America fell as deeply in love with the borderless pop bliss of “Hey Ya!” as it did with the slick talk and soulful horns on “The Way You Move.”'},\n",

The world didn’t know yet the private hell Tina was living through — or that she’d move on to solo stardom. But Tina’s grit and Ike’s guitar combine from the start, in duets like “I Idolize You.” Her triumph is “Proud Mary,” seizing the already-classic Creedence song and turning it into her own soul testimony.'},\n",

Producer Willie Mitchell and his studio band of virtuoso Memphis R&amp;B pros create the sultriest grooves south of the Mason-Dixon line. Green testifies to the glories of love in “Call Me” and “Have You Been Making Out O.K.” When he reaches up for that falsetto growl at the end of “Your Love Is Like the Morning Sun,” it’s like he’s bringing down the sugar walls of Jericho.'},\n",

What’s even more staggering is the way Vernon’s Auto-Tune and falsetto-laden DIY debut, which centered around the heartsick “Skinny Love,” would reshape the contours of the pop mainstream — from Ed Sheeran and Kanye West to James Blake and Taylor Swift — for years to come.'},\n",

As her second album showed, that wasn’t quite accurate — she’s more like the voice of smart, self-conscious, neurotic people of all generations. “I think that you might be the same as me/Behave abnormally,” she sings on “Homemade Dynamite.” The sound is bigger-sounding and more club-friendly than the spare sound of her 2016 debut (especially on the single ;Green Light;), and she’s even more impressive on a big stage.'},\n",

On his debut LP, the Cleveland rapper took that sound further and deeper, merging emo and psychedelic rock with hip-hop bombast. His introspect runs the gamut from the severe depression of “Day ‘n’ Nite” to the sweet contentment of “Pursuit of Happiness,” both of which became unlikely hits. A decade after <em>Man on the Moon,</em> every chart is dominated by Kudi’s sad children.'},\n",

Coltrane also kicked heroin addiction, a vital step in a spiritual awakening that climaxed with this legendary album-long hymn of praise &#x2013; transcendent music perfect for the high point of the civil rights movement. The indelible four-note theme of the first piece, &quot;Acknowledgment,&quot; is the humble foundation of the suite.

The Band&apos;s long life on the road resonates in the brawn of Garth Hudson&apos;s keyboards and Helm&apos;s juke-joint attack. But Robertson&apos;s stories truly live in Helm&apos;s growl, Rick Danko&apos;s high tenor and Richard Manuel&apos;s spectral croon. &quot;Somebody once said he had a tear in his voice,&quot; Helm said of Manuel. &quot;Richard had one of the richest-textured voices I&apos;d ever heard.&quot;'},\n",

She sought the visions and passions that connected Keith Richards</a> and Rimbaud &#x2013; and found them, with the intuitive assistance of a killing band (pianist Richard Sohl, guitarist Lenny Kaye, bassist Ivan Kral and drummer Jay Dee Daugherty) and her friend Robert Mapplethorpe, who shot the stark, beautiful cover portrait.'},\n",

But in the studio, the band articulated bassist Roger Waters&apos; reveries on the madness of everyday life with melodic precision (&quot;Breathe,&quot; &quot;Us and Them&quot;) and cinematic luster (Clare Torry&apos;s guest-vocal aria, &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot;).

And for good reason: The third record by his biracial L.A. band is wild and funny and totally pioneering: folk rock turned into elegant Armageddon with the symphonic sweep and mariachi-brass drama of &quot;Alone Again Or&quot; and &quot;You Set the Scene.&quot; In the late Nineties, Lee served time in prison.

But when he moved to Chicago in 1943, he needed an electric guitar to be heard over the tumult of South Side clubs.

Jimi Hendrix</a> adapted Waters&apos; &quot;Rollin&apos; Stone&quot; for &quot;Voodoo Chile,&quot; Bob Dylan</a> found inspiration in it for &quot;Like a Rolling Stone,&quot; and Mick Jagger</a> and Keith Richards</a> took their band&apos;s name from it.

No album in recent history had such an overpowering impact on a generation &#x2013; a nation of teens suddenly turned punk &#x2013; and such a catastrophic effect on its main creator. The weight of fame led already troubled singer-guitarist Kurt Cobain</a> to take his own life in 1994.

Lyrically, Cobain raged in code &#x2013; shorthand grenades of inner tumult and self-loathing.

Cobain also fought to maintain his underground honor. Ultimately, it was a losing battle, but it is part of this album&apos;s enduring power. Vig recalls when Cobain was forced to overdub the guitar intro to &quot;Teen Spirit&quot; because he couldn&apos;t nail it live with the band:&#x2008;&quot;That pissed him off.

In fact, he wrote all of these lyrically piercing, gingerly majestic songs in two months, in mid-1974. He was so proud of them that he privately auditioned almost all of the album, from start to finish, for pals and peers including Mike Bloomfield, David Crosby and Graham Nash before cutting them in September &#x2013; in just a week, with members of the bluegrass band Deliverance. But in December, Dylan played the record for his brother David in Minneapolis, who suggested recutting some songs with local musicians. The final Blood was a mix of the slow, pensive New York sessions and the faster, wilder Minneapolis dates. Together, they frame the gritty anguish in some of Dylan&apos;s most passionate, confessional songs &#x2013; from adult breakup ballads like &quot;If You See Her, Say Hello&quot; to the sharp-tongued opprobrium of &quot;Idiot Wind,&quot; his greatest put-down song since &quot;Like a Rolling Stone.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s hard for me to relate to people enjoying that type of pain,&quot; Dylan said after the album became an instant success.

Darling&quot;), silly (&quot;Maxwell&apos;s Silver Hammer&quot;) and deliciously bitter (&quot;You Never Give Me Your Money&quot;). George Harrison</a> proved his long-secret worth as a composer with &quot;Something&quot;&#x2008;and the folk-pop diamond &quot;Here Comes the Sun,&quot; written in his friend Eric Clapton</a>&apos;s garden while playing hooky from a business meeting. And Lennon, McCartney and Harrison reputedly sang more three-part harmony here than on any other Beatles album. <em>Let It Be</em> was the group&apos;s final release, but this album was its real goodbye.'},\n",

       "  'Descrição': '&quot;We were trying to do a Phil Spector thing with as few instruments as possible,&quot; John Cale, the classically trained pianist and viola player of the Velvet Underground</a>, said of this record. It was no idle boast. Much of what we take for granted in rock would not exist without this New York band or its seminal debut: the androgynous sexuality of glitter; punk&apos;s raw noir; the blackened-riff howl of grunge and noise rock; goth&apos;s imperious gloom. Recorded dirt-cheap at a studio that was literally falling apart, it is a record of fearless breadth and lyric depth. Singer-songwriter Lou Reed documented carnal desire and drug addiction, decadence and redemption, with a pop wisdom he learned as a song-factory composer for Pickwick Records. Cale introduced the power of pulse and drone (from his work with minimalist composer La Monte Young); guitarist Sterling Morrison and drummer Maureen Tucker played with tribal force; Nico, a German vocalist added to the band by manager Andy Warhol, brought an icy femininity to the heated ennui in Reed&apos;s songs. Rejected as nihilistic by the love crowd in &apos;67, the Banana Album (so named for its Warhol-designed cover) is the most pro&#xAD;phetic rock album ever made.'},\n",

       "  'Descrição': 'This painterly masterpiece would become one of the most important, influential and popular albums in jazz. But at the time it was made, <em>Kind of Blue</em> was a revolution all its own, a radical break from everything going on. Turning his back on standard chord progressions, trumpeter Miles Davis</a> used modal scales as a starting point for composition and improvisation &#x2013; breaking new ground with warmth, subtlety and understatement in the thick of hard bop. Davis and his peerless band &#x2013; bassist Paul Chambers, drummer Jimmy Cobb, pianist Bill Evans, and the titanic sax team of John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley &#x2013; soloed in uncluttered settings, typified by &quot;melodic rather than harmonic variation,&quot; as Davis put it. Two numbers, &quot;All Blues&quot; and &quot;Freddie Freeloader&quot; (the latter featured Wynton Kelly at the ivories in place of Evans), were in 12-bar form, but Davis&apos; approach allowed his players a cool, new, collected freedom. Evans wrote in his original liner notes, &quot;Miles conceived these settings only hours before the re&#xAD;cording dates and arrived with sketches which indicated to the group what was to be played. Therefore, you will hear something close to pure spontaneity in these performances.&quot; Or as the late critic Robert Palmer wrote, &quot;<em>Kind of Blue</em> is, in a sense, all melody &#x2013; and atmosphere.&quot; The bass line in &quot;So What&quot; is now among the most familiar obbligatos in jazz, and there is no finer evocation of the late-night wonder of jazz than the muted horns in &quot;All Blues.&quot;'},\n",

       "  'Descrição': 'Many believe rock &amp; roll was born on July 5th, 1954, at Sun Studio in Memphis. Elvis Presley</a>, guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black were horsing around with &quot;That&apos;s All Right, Mama,&quot; a tune by bluesman Arthur &quot;Big Boy&quot; Crudup, when producer Sam Phillips stopped them and asked, &quot;What are you doing?&quot; &quot;We don&apos;t know,&quot; they said. Phillips told them to &quot;back up and do it again.&quot; The A side of Presley&apos;s first single (backed with a version of Bill Monroe&apos;s &quot;Blue Moon of Kentucky&quot;), &quot;That&apos;s All Right&quot; was issued by Sun on July 19th. It may or may not be the first rock &amp; roll record. But the man who would be King was officially on wax. Bridging black and white, country and blues, his sound was playful and revolutionary, charged by a spontaneity and freedom that changed the world. &quot;It&apos;s the blues,&quot; critic Greil Marcus wrote in his classic book <em>Mystery Train</em>. &quot;But free of all worry, all sin; a simple joy with no price to pay.&quot; Presley released four more singles on Sun &#x2013; including definitive reinventions of Wynonie Harris&apos; &quot;Good Rockin&apos; Tonight&quot; and Junior Parker&apos;s &quot;Mystery Train&quot; &#x2013; before moving on to immortality when Phillips sold his contract to RCA for $35,000. Incredibly, it took more than 20 years for Presley&apos;s Sun output to be properly collected on a 1976 LP &#x2013; which has since been superseded by this 1999 double-CD chronicle of the King&apos;s beginnings at Sun. It collects everything he cut at the studio, including alternate takes and the 1953 acetate he recorded as a gift for his mother as a shy and awkward recent high school graduate.'},\n",

As John Lennon</a> later said, &quot;We sat in the mountains eating lousy vegetarian food and writing all these songs.&quot; They came back with more great tunes than they could fit on a single LP, and competed fiercely during the sessions. &quot;I remember having three studios operating at the same time,&quot; George Harrison</a> recalled. &quot;Paul was doing some overdubs in one, John was in another, and I was recording some horns or something in a third.&quot; The sessions became so tense that Ringo Starr quit the band in frustration for two weeks.

Even Starr</a> contributed his first original, the country-tinged &quot;Don&apos;t Pass Me By.&quot; &quot;I think it was a very good album,&quot; said McCartney. &quot;It stood up, but it wasn&apos;t a pleasant one to make.&quot;'},\n",

Produced with no-surrender energy by legendary Seventies studio madman Guy Stevens, the Clash</a>&apos;s third album skids from bleak punk (&quot;London Calling&quot;) to rampaging ska (&quot;Wrong &apos;Em Boyo&quot;) and disco resignation (&quot;Lost in the Supermarket&quot;). The album was made in dire straits too. The band was heavily in debt and openly at war with its record company. Singer-guitarists Joe Strummer and Mick Jones wrote together in Jones&apos; grandmother&apos;s flat. &quot;Joe, once he learned how to type, would bang the lyrics out,&quot; Jones said. &quot;Then I&apos;d be able to bang out some music while he was hitting the typewriter.&quot; Strummer, Jones, bassist Paul Simonon and drummer Topper Headon spent nearly three months rehearsing and demoing songs in a garage in the Pimlico section of London &#x2013; &quot;with one light and filthy carpet on the walls for soundproofing,&quot; recalled Strummer in 1989. &quot;We felt that we were struggling,&quot; he said, &quot;about to slide down a slope or something, grasping with our fingernails.&quot; But Stevens was on hand for inspiration. He threw chairs around the room &quot;if he thought a track needed zapping up,&quot; according to Strummer. The album ends with &quot;Train in Vain,&quot; a rousing song of fidelity (unlisted on the back cover because it was added at the last minute) that became the sound of triumph: the Clash&apos;s first Top 30 single in the U.S.'},\n",

       "  'Descrição': 'A dirty whirl of blues and boogie, the Rolling Stones</a>&apos; 1972 double LP &quot;was the first grunge record,&quot; guitarist Keith Richards</a> crowed proudly in a 2002 interview. But inside the deliberately dense squall &#x2013; Richards&apos;  and Mick Taylor&apos;s dogfight riffing, the lusty jump of the Bill Wyman-Charlie Watts rhythm engine, Mick Jagger</a>&apos;s caged-&#xAD;animal bark and burned-soul croon &#x2013; is the Stones&apos; greatest album and Jagger and Richards&apos; definitive songwriting statement of outlaw pride and dedication to grit. In the existential shuffle &quot;Tumbling Dice,&quot; the exhausted country beauty &quot;Torn and Frayed&quot; and the whiskey-soaked uplift of &quot;Shine a Light,&quot; you literally hear the Stones in exile: working at Richards&apos; villa in the South of France, and on the run from media censure, British drug police (Jagger and Richards already knew the view from behind bars) and the country&apos;s onerous tax code. <em>Exile</em> is rife with allusions to their outsider status: The album&apos;s cover is a collage of freakish American characters, and on &quot;Sweet Black Angel&quot; they toast imprisoned activist Angela Davis &#x2013; one set of renegades to another. The music rattles like battle but also swings with clear purpose on songs like &quot;Rocks Off&quot; and &quot;All Down the Line.&quot; As Richards explained, &quot;The Stones don&apos;t have a home anymore &#x2013; hence the <em>Exile</em> &#x2013; but they can still keep it together. Whatever people throw at us, we can still duck, improvise, overcome.&quot; Great example: Richards recorded his jubilant romp &quot;Happy&quot; with just producer Jimmy Miller on drums and saxman Bobby Keys &#x2013; while waiting for the other Stones to turn up for work. <em>Exile on Main Street</em> is the Stones at their fighting best, armed with the blues, playing to win.'},\n",
